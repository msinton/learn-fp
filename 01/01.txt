| \gA simple example on the benefits of FP
--


```
trait CreditCard { def charge(amount: Int)}
trait Cup { def price: Int }

class Coffee extends Cup { def price: Int = 249 }

class Cafe {
  def buyCoffee(cc: CreditCard): Coffee = {
    val cup = new Coffee()
    cc.charge(cup.price)
    cup
  }
}
```

--
- where is the side effect?

--
- how do you test?

--
- how can we improve?

---

| \gTestable

```
trait Payments {
  def charge(cc: CreditCard, amount: Int): Unit 
}

class Cafe {
  def buyCoffee(cc: CreditCard, payments: Payments): Coffee = {
    val cup = new Coffee()
    payments.charge(cc, cup.price)
    cup
  }
}
```

/\m+\c=\s

```
case class Charge(cc: CreditCard, amount: Int)

class Cafe {
  def buyCoffee(cc: CreditCard): (Coffee, Charge) = {
    val cup = new Coffee()
    (cup, Charge(cc, cup.price))
  }
}
```

\*what are the benefits?

--
- buy coffees
- coalesce
--

| We still need side effects but concentrating them into smaller portions of the code base has huge benefits

| \gReferential Transparency

--
\*What is it?

related to Pure Functions but it is a more general principle (for expressions - not only functions)
We’ll start with a simple definition and then look at a more formal definition later

--
\*Simple definition

Take a reference (a val) and then substitute that reference with what the val refers to and nothing changes.
--

Example:
```
val x = "Hello World"
val r1 = x.reverse
val r2 = x.reverse
```
--
Replace occurrences of x with the expression it references

```
val r1 = "Hello World".reverse
val r2 = "Hello World".reverse
```
---

RT is a bit boring - that's a good thing. We don't want to be suprised!
--

What is not RT?
--

```
val x = new StringBuilder("Hello")
val y = x.append(" World")
val r1 = y.toString
val r2 = y.toString
```
--

Again, now we replace y

```
val x = new StringBuilder("Hello")
val r1 = x.append(" World").toString
val r2 = x.append(" World").toString
```
--

\*append\s is not a pure function and therefore \*y\s is not RT
--
/\m+\c=\s
\*Referential Transparency:\s
An expression \ce\s is RT if, for all programs \mp\s, all occurrences of \ce\s in p can be replaced by the
result of evaluating \ce\s - without affecting the meaning of \mp\s.

\*Pure Functions:\s
A function \yf\s is pure if the expression \yf\s(\cx\s) is referentially transparent for all referentially transparent \mx\s

/\m+\c=\s
